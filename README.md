# justTODOit
This is my program for 10th Challenge. From it I want to learn about Web applications and rust Rocket framework.

# TODO
- [ ] Understand [example](https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/2024/02/28/how-to-write-your-first-rust-web-app-with-rocket-and-rustrover/)
    - [x] Add [pico css framework](https://picocss.com/docs)

# Notes
- There are things called templates in web development. They are just HTML but some parts are replaced by the server. Example of them are Handlebars, with a keywords like *if* or *each* for better control.
